Survival Analysis model in "R" language for predicting mortality caused by Heart Failure.

Introduction : 
Cardiovascular diseases claim the lives of approximately 17 million people worldwide each
year, primarily manifesting as heart attacks and heart failure. Heart failure (HF) occurs when the heart is
unable to pump sufficient blood to meet the bodyâ€™s needs.

Electronic medical records (EMRs) of patients provide a wealth of data, including symptoms, physical
characteristics, and clinical laboratory test results. This data can be analyzed using biostatistics to uncover
patterns and correlations that might be missed by medical professionals.

Machine learning, in particular, offers powerful tools for predicting patient survival based on their medical
data. It can also identify the most critical features within these records, providing valuable insights for
healthcare providers.

Dataset : 
The dataset includes cardiovascular medical records from 299 patients, consisting of 105 women
and 194 men aged between 40 and 95 years. All patients were diagnosed with systolic dysfunction of the left
ventricle and had a history of heart failure. Consequently, each patient was classified into either class III or
class IV of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, indicating various stages of heart failure.
